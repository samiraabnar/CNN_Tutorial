    "## Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "In machine learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the human visual cortex, whose individual neurons are arranged in such a way that they respond to overlapping regions tiling the visual field. Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes and are variations of multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing. They have wide applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing [[weekipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)]."

It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples[wikipedia].

    "\n",
    "Convolutional layer has two steps, convolution and pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"CNN_layer.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural images have the property of being stationary, meaning that the statistics of one part of the image are the same as any other part. This suggests that the features that we learn at one part of the image can also be applied to other parts of the image, and we can use the same features at all locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, having learned features over small (say 8x8) patches sampled randomly from the larger image, we can then apply this learned 8x8 feature detector anywhere in the image. Specifically, we can take the learned 8x8 features and convolve them with the larger image, thus obtaining a different feature activation value at each location in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get an idea of what happens in the convolution step from this picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"conv_gif.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining features using convolution, we would next like to use them for classification. In theory, one could use all the extracted features with a classifier such as a softmax classifier, but this can be computationally challenging. Consider for instance images of size 96x96 pixels, and suppose we have learned 400 features over 8x8 inputs. Each convolution results in an output of size (96 − 8 + 1) * (96 − 8 + 1) = 7921, and since we have 400 features, this results in a vector of 892 * 400 = 3,168,400 features per example. Learning a classifier with inputs having 3+ million features can be unwieldy, and can also be prone to over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, first recall that we decided to obtain convolved features because images have the \"stationarity\" property, which implies that features that are useful in one region are also likely to be useful for other regions. Thus, to describe a large image, one natural approach is to aggregate statistics of these features at various locations. For example, one could compute the mean (or max) value of a particular feature over a region of the image. These summary statistics are much lower in dimension (compared to using all of the extracted features) and can also improve results (less over-fitting). We aggregation operation is called this operation pooling, or sometimes mean pooling or max pooling (depending on the pooling operation applied).\n",
    "The following image shows how pooling is done over 4 non-overlapping regions of the image.\n",
